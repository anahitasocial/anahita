## Upgrading

If you are upgrading from 4.5.* to 4.6.* you will need a client side applications such as [Anahita React](https://github.com/anahitasocial/anahita-react) as your front end, since Anahita will only provide a RESTful JSON API and no html outputs. If you need time to build a client app, you may point your installation to the _legacy_ branch for the time being.

If you are upgrading from 4.3.* to 4.4.*, in `www/configuration.php` file, change `AnConfig` to `AnSiteConfig`.

If you are using any previous 4.* versions of Anahita, [here is how to upgrade](https://www.anahita.io/articles/158983-updating-from-anahita-4-2-to-4-3)
