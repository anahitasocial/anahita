## Embryo and Birth releases

The code in the master branch is called the **Embryo**. It is what we use to power our website [Anahita.io](https://www.anahita.io) and it is constantly changing and evolving. It may contain bugs that are being fixed. Experimental features may be added and removed. Whenever we reach a specific milestone and the codebase is stable, it is packaged as a **Birth** release.
